About
-----
Distributed Hash tables don't have allot of documentation online nor are their many libraries that are easy to use and customization. This library offers an easy to use approach to DHTs. You can create your own RoutingTable, Messages, EventHandlers, and Refresh Tasks.

Implementation
-----
Implementing rKad4 is very easy, just download the files and add it as a library to your project.
